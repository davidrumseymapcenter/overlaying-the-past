For this workshop we are using pure unframeworked JavaScript, also known as **_vanilla_** JavaScript. Vanilla JavaScript only uses the core capabilities of JavaScript itselfâ€”without any additional libraries or frameworks for building app such as [React](https://react.dev/), [Angular](https://angular.dev/), or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). Learning pure vanilla JavaScript is good for lightweight projects where you have full control over every line of code, and it really good for people who are just starting out and want to understand the core principles of JavaScript before diving into more complex code ecosystems.

### Other Vanilla Code Libraries

We've chosen Mapbox to work with today, but there are other vanilla JavaScript libraries for you to use for web maps.

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - Old reliable, free, open, no accounts needed. Minimal code that still works!
- [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) - Another old reliable that has been actively developed recently. Free and open.
- [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/) - Newish platform with active development. Free and open.
- [D3](https://d3js.org/) - D3.js (Data Driven Documents) has a steep learning curve, but allows for very elegant styling and interactions.

### Other Popular Web Map Frameworks

- [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/components/) -
- [Kepler](https://kepler.gl/) - Originally created by Uber, vector-based (Deck.gl). Able to perform complex visualizations. Free and open.
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps) - Well-known and documented. Integrates with Google Maps data (traffic, streets, etc.). Not free or open
