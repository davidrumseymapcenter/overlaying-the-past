For our web maps to be sharable in the web, we'll need to store and publish them online. In this workshop, we will use GitHub's web hosting feature called [Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="\_blank"}.

## Create a Free GitHub Account

[GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="\_blank"} is a platform for managing software and code development projects, and for building a community of practice for open source tools and software. At the core of GitHub is the version control system Git. Git is a widely used version control system that tracks changes to a group of files, referred to as a repository. We won't be focusing on learning Git or GitHub for this workshop and previous experience is not required. However, Git and GitHub are essential tools for anyone hoping to learn code and manage application development projects â€“ such as building web maps! If you would like to learn more about these tools, there are many resources online, such as:

- Software Carpentry's [_Version Control with Git_](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/){:target="\_blank"} Workshop
- The Coding Train's [_Git and GitHub for Poets_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV){:target="\_blank"} YouTube Playlist
