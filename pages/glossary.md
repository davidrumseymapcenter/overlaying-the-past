## Access Token

A unique identifier used to authenticate requests to Mapbox services. Required for using Mapbox GL JS and accessing Mapbox-hosted resources.

## Allmaps

A platform for georeferencing and sharing historical maps as web map overlays, often providing XYZ tile endpoints for use in web maps.

## API (Application Programming Interface)

A set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. Mapbox provides APIs for map styles and data.

## Base Map / Base Layer

The foundational map layer providing geographic context (such as streets, terrain, or satellite imagery) over which additional data layers are displayed.

## Boilerplate

A reusable chunk of code that serves as a starting template for new projects, ensuring consistency and saving setup time.

## Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)

A format for storing geospatial raster data optimized for cloud-based access and efficient streaming.

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

A language used to describe the presentation and layout of HTML elements on a web page.

## Data Overlay

Additional data (such as points, lines, polygons, or raster images) displayed on top of a base map to provide more information.

## Event Listener

A JavaScript function that waits for and responds to user interactions, such as clicks or slider movements.

## GeoJSON

A widely used format for encoding geographic data structures (points, lines, polygons) in JSON.

## GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library)

An open-source toolkit for processing and converting geospatial raster and vector data.

## Git

A version control system for tracking changes in files and coordinating work among multiple people.

## GitHub

A web-based platform for hosting code repositories and collaborating on software development projects using Git.

## GitHub Pages

A GitHub feature that allows users to publish static websites directly from a repository.

## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

The standard language for creating web pages and web applications.

## JavaScript

A programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

## Live Server

A VS Code extension that launches a local development server with live reload capability for web development.

## Local Development Environment (LDE)

The setup of tools and software (such as VS Code, browser, and local server) used to develop and test code on your own computer.

## Mapbox GL JS

A JavaScript library for interactive, customizable vector maps on the web.

## Map Tile / Tile Server

A small, square image (usually 256x256 pixels) representing a portion of a map at a specific zoom level, served by a tile server.

## Popup

A small window or tooltip that appears on a map to display information about a feature when clicked or hovered.

## Raster

A grid of pixels (such as an image or scanned map) used as a map layer.

## Slider (Transparency/Opacity Slider)

A user interface control that allows users to adjust the transparency of a map layer.

## Style (Mapbox Style)

A JSON document that defines the visual appearance of a map, including colors, fonts, and which layers are shown.

## Tile / XYZ Tile

A map image served at a specific zoom level and x/y coordinate, following the XYZ tiling scheme.

## Vector Tile

A tile format that encodes geographic features as vector data (points, lines, polygons) rather than raster images, allowing for dynamic styling.

## VS Code (Visual Studio Code)

A free, extensible code editor from Microsoft, commonly used for web development.

## Web Map

An interactive digital map designed for use in web browsers, supporting features like zooming, panning, and data overlays.

## Web Map Service (WMS)

A standard protocol for serving georeferenced map images over the internet.
