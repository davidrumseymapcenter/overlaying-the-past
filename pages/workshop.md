# Workshop Overview

This is the final workshop of a 4-part set where we have started from nothing, and are finishing by creating a web map ready to deploy online. The web map will display a georeferenced raster map and vector data that we've traced from the map in previous workshops in this series. In this final part of the series, we are going to focus on using a code editor to insert blocks of code one at a time to build a web map.

## Code Development

We will not focus on learning how to write JavaScript, CSS, HTML, or any other code from scratch. Instead, the emphasis will be on getting hands-on experience by copying and pasting pre-written code into your development environment and observing how this code changes your web map. The primary objective is to help you become familiar with this process and gradually build the confidence to explore more advanced topics on your own.

We'll be copying and pasting a lot of code. When working with code, **_syntax_** is extremely important. It's good to work slowly to ensure you're copying and pasting the entire code block in the right location.

## Further Documentation

The majority of the content covered in this workshop has been derived directly from the official [Mapbox GL JS documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/){:target="\_blank"}, ensuring that you're learning from authoritative and up-to-date sources. We've chosen Mapbox for several reasons: it's a modern platform that handles numerous aspects remarkably well and aligns closely with current industry standards. As always, it is a good idea to become familiar with the documentation offered by the code authors or distributors. Code lacking extensive documentation may be risky!

## Other Acknolwedgements

UBC (University of British Columbia) Library has been creating [online data science learning modules](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}, inlcuding for web maps, which are posted online. These workshops also informed how we proceed with learning here.
